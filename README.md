# Raycast New Instance

A Raycast extension that allows you to launch a new instance of any installed application on your Mac.

## Usage

1. Open Raycast
2. Type "New Instance" 
3. Search for the application you want to launch

This is particularly useful for applications like Blender, VS Code, or any other app where you might want multiple instances running simultaneously that don't support multiple instances by default.
